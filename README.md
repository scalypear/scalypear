# About me
Born in the year of our Lord 2000, Katherine was a precocious child, excelling in everything she did. By age 10, she was already a chess grand master, spinal surgeon, and world-renowned impressionist. By 25 she had become the UK's youngest Prime Minister and the first person to successfully push over the leaning tower of Pisa mid-photo. She sadly died aged 150, breaking the record for longest living human. She is outlived by her army of despotic ants.

## Interests?! I got 'em:
- Music
- Coding 
- Sci-fi realism (LOST, Orphan Black, The Last of Us, Severance, Sense8, you get the idea)
- TTRPGs
- Animation
- 3D modelling

## Projects? You know it baby:
- Unique Frames: an animator's tool to get the unique frames of a video. Supports pixelwise comparison, structural similarity indexing, perceptual hashing, edge comparison, and histogram comparison.
- PySide6 Custom Title Bars: a custom class that allows developers more customisation over their title bars in PySide6.

## Wanna make things?
What I lack in skill, I make up for in size- I mean, enthusiasm. If you want to collaborate on something, just hit me up!
